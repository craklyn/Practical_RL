    "## Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "The full list of assumptions is\n",
    "* __Finite actions__ - we enumerate all actions in `expand`\n",
    "* __Episodic (finite) MDP__ - while technically it works for infinite mdp, we rollout for $ 10^4$ steps. If you are knowingly infinite, please adjust `t_max` to something more reasonable.\n",
    "* __No discounted rewards__ - we assume $\\gamma=1$. If that isn't the case, you only need to change two lines in `rollout` and use `my_R = r + gamma*child_R` for `propagate`\n",
    "* __pickleable env__ - won't work if e.g. your env is connected to a web-browser surfing the internet. For custom envs, you may need to modify get_snapshot/load_snapshot from `WithSnapshots`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### On `get_best_leaf` and `expand` functions\n",
    "\n",
    "This MCTS implementation only selects leaf nodes for expansion.\n",
    "This doesn't break things down because `expand` adds all possible actions. Hence, all non-leaf nodes are by design fully expanded and shouldn't be selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to only add a few random action on each expand, you will also have to modify `get_best_leaf` to consider returning non-leafs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rollout policy\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a simple uniform policy for rollouts. This introduces a negative bias to good situations that can be messed up completely with random bad action. As a simple example, if you tend to rollout with uniform policy, you better don't use sharp knives and walk near cliffs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can improve that by integrating a reinforcement _learning_ algorithm with a computationally light agent. You can even train this agent on optimal policy found by the tree search.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Contributions\n",
    "* Reusing some code from 5vision [solution for deephack.RL](https://github.com/5vision/uct_atari), code by Mikhail Pavlov\n",
